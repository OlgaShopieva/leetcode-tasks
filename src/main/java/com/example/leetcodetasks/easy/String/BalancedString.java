/**
 * Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
 * Given a balanced string s, split it into some number of substrings such that:
 * Each substring is balanced.
 * Return the maximum number of balanced strings you can obtain.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
 * Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
